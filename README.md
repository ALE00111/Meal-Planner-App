Welcome to my MEAL-PLANNER-APP
This is one of my first full stack applications i have done!
I accept all critiques on how to improve and new features that I can possibly implement

Functionality: 
This web application has two functions:
1.To track and calculate the amount of calories you've eaten in a day, week, etc..
2.To produce random recipes based on dietary and health preferences for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Steps to use:
1. First for safety and secuirty reasons i can't upload my specific mongoDB databse, but I provided all of the JSON files so that you can replicate the database on your own
2. Clone the repo
3. There are multiple ways to run the program, but the way I do it on VS code is open two terminals and specifically mkdir to client and mkdir into server on the other
4. On the client one, do npm start
5. On the server one, do python meal.py
6. Then open http://localhost:3000/ and you're all set!

Below are extra React npm commands you can use in the terminal to try out.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
